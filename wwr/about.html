                <p>Riverbound White Water Rafting exists to connect people with the raw beauty and power of nature
                    through unforgettable river journeys. Our mission is to guide every rafter safely through the rapids
                    while sparking courage, laughter, and lasting memories. We believe that adventure builds character,
                    teamwork deepens bonds, and the river itself teaches resilience and respect. Our creed is simple:
                    safety first, spirit always, and nature as our constant guide. Our motto: “Go with the flow. Leave
                    with a story.”</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Riverbound White Water Rafting was born from a group of friends who shared two passions: the rush of
                untamed rivers and the joy of bringing people together in the outdoors. What started as weekend rafting
                trips along local rapids grew into a vision—creating a company where anyone, from first-timers to
                seasoned adventurers, could experience the thrill and beauty of white water. From a single raft and a
                handful of paddles, Riverbound has grown into a trusted guide service known for safety, camaraderie, and
                unforgettable journeys. Through every wave and rapid, our story has remained the same: the river leads,
                and we follow—together.</p>
